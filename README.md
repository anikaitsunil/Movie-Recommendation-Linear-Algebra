# Movie Recommendation Using Surprise and SVD 
### Course: DSC 210 - Numerical Linear Algebra for Data Science
### Instructor: Prof. Lily Weng

## Introduction: 
This is a project that uses techniques from the field of Linear Algebra to predict movies to a user based on the ratings that the user has assigned for the other movies that the user has watched.
Python is a really useful tool for working with data. It has lots of different parts you can use, called libraries. These libraries help make things faster and easier. One cool thing Python can do is make recommendations. That means suggesting things to people, like movies or products they might like. These suggestions can help businesses sell more, make customers happier, and keep them coming back for more. There are so many things to choose from nowadays, and recommendation systems help people decide by suggesting things they might enjoy.

## Libraries Used:

In this project, we've utilized several libraries and tools.Ensure that the following libraries are installed in python 3 environment:

1. **Python Programming Language:** The entire project is written in Python.
2. **Surprise Library:** This library, integrated into Python, provides tools for building and evaluating recommendation systems. It includes algorithms like SVD, SVD++, NMF, etc.
3. **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis, especially for handling the MovieLens dataset as DataFrames.
4. **NumPy:** Employed for numerical operations and handling arrays, especially in matrix computations.
5. **Matplotlib:** Utilized for data visualization, allowing the creation of graphs and plots for visual analysis.
6. **urllib:** Used for downloading files from URLs.
7. **zipfile:** Used for extracting files from the downloaded zip file.

To use the Surprise module, make sure you install it by using **pip3 install scikit-surprise**

Open Final_Linear_Algebra_Movie_Prediction.ipynb and run all the cells of the notebook.
